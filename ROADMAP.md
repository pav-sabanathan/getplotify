  watch progress data

Features under consideration for post-V5 development, 
subject to user feedback and validation.

- "Catch Me Up" feature for shows you've fallen behind on
- Social layer — share watchlist, see what friends watch
- Mobile app (React Native / Expo)
- Recommendation engine based on watch history

## 📊 Roadmap Principles

Every version of Plotify is guided by three questions:

1. **Does this solve a real problem for a real user?**
2. **Is this the smallest version that delivers genuine value?**
3. **Does this create the foundation for what comes next?**

Features that can't answer yes to all three get pushed 
to a later version or removed entirely.
