  (20+ shows pre-loaded with full metadata)

context before entering the app.

- Footer with Privacy Policy and Terms of Service placeholders

## ⚙️ V4 — Settings & Customisation — In Planning

Giving users control over their experience and expanding 
platform coverage beyond the built-in list.

- Settings menu accessible from all screens
- Custom streaming service creation with colour picker
- Custom services populate Add Show dropdown dynamically
- Display preferences toggle (show/hide past episodes)
- About section with version history
- Feedback mechanism surfaced in settings

---

## 🔐 V5 — Authentication & Data Persistence — In Planning

The milestone that takes Plotify from demo to real product. 
Requires Supabase integration — architectural review with 
engineering collaborator before starting.

- Supabase authentication (email/password + Google OAuth)
- User account creation and sign-in flow
- Cross-device data persistence for all show and 
  watch progress data
- Guest mode with sign-in prompt for unauthenticated users
- User avatar and account menu in app header
  
### 🔭 V5 — Additional Scope Note
Replace mock show database (introduced in V2) with 
a live TMDb API integration. API key to be stored 
server-side via Supabase to avoid front-end exposure. 
Attribution required: "This product uses the TMDb 
API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb."

**New season detection:** On app open, Plotify checks 
TMDb for premiere date updates on shows marked as 
"ended" or "between seasons" in the user's watchlist. 
If a new season premiere date is found, the calendar 
is updated automatically and the user is notified 
via toast. Scope: V5 alongside TMDb integration.

---

## 🔭 Future Versions — Backlog

Features under consideration for post-V5 development, 
subject to user feedback and validation.

- Push notifications (episode dropping tomorrow alerts)
- Google Calendar and Apple Calendar native sync
- "Catch Me Up" feature for shows you've fallen behind on
- Social layer — share watchlist, see what friends watch
- Mobile app (React Native / Expo)
- Recommendation engine based on watch history

---

## 📊 Roadmap Principles

Every version of Plotify is guided by three questions:

1. **Does this solve a real problem for a real user?**
2. **Is this the smallest version that delivers genuine value?**
3. **Does this create the foundation for what comes next?**

Features that can't answer yes to all three get pushed 
to a later version or removed entirely.
